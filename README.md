# fty-sensor-gpio

fty-sensor-gpio is an agent to manage GPI sensors and GPO devices. It is able
to read status of any kind of GPIO devices or set (enable / disable) any GPO.

GPIO devices are basic dry-contact, which are either 'opened' or 'closed', to
indicate a status or enable / disable a device.

## How to build

To build fty-sensor-gpio project run:

```bash
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make check # to run self-test
```

## How to run

To run fty-sensor-gpio project:

* from within the source tree, run:

```bash
./src/fty-sensor-gpio
```

For the other options available, refer to the manual page of fty-sensor-gpio

* from an installed base, using systemd, run:

```bash
systemctl start fty-sensor-gpio
```

### Configuration file and request

To configure fty-sensor-gpio, a configuration file exists: fty-sensor-gpio.cfg

Beside from the standard configuration directives, under the server and malamute
sections, hardware capabilities are requested to the fty-info agents, to adapt
to the behavior of fty-sensor-gpio, using:

* HW_CAP/'msg-correlation-id'/gpi
* HW_CAP/'msg-correlation-id'/gpo

This answer will allow to get: 
* gpi_count: (mandatory) the number of GPI (10 on IPC3000)
* gpo_count: (mandatory) the number of GPO (5 on IPC3000)
* gpio_base_address: (optional) the target address of the GPIO chipset (488 for
the gpiochip488 on IPC3000)
* gpo_offset: (optional) the offset to apply to access GPO pins, from base
chipset address.
15 on IPC3000, so GPO pins have +15 offset, i.e. GPO 1 is pin 16, ...
* gpi_offset: (optional) the offset to apply to access GPI pins, from base
chipset address.
-1 on IPC3000, so GPI pins have -1 offset, i.e. GPI 1 is pin 0, ...

### Commissioning using CSV file

It is possible to declare GPIO sensors through the CSV file.
The following fields and extended attributes are available:

* name (mandatory)
* type (mandatory): set to 'device'
* sub_type (mandatory): set to 'sensorgpio'
* parent_name.1 (optional): refer to the IPC to which the sensor is connected.
* status (optional): is the standard status 'active' or 'inactive'
* priority (optional): is the standard priority, from 'P1' to 'P5'
* model (mandatory): is the part number of the GPIO sensor, use for naming
the template files
* port (mandatory): is the GPI or GPO pin number to which the sensor is
connected to. The pin number of the GPIO is then computed based on this number
and the configured 'gpi_offset' and 'gpo_offset'.
* normal_state (optional): is the status of the sensor under nominal conditions.
Possible values are 'opened' or 'closed'. When not provided, the value from the
template file is used. Otherwise, the provided value takes precedence.
* logical_asset (optional): is the deployment location of the sensor. For
example, a door contact sensor can be located on the door of a rack or room.
Hence, the value will be the name of this rack or room.
* gpo_powersource (optional): some GPI sensors need an external power supply.
IPC itself can provide 12V power through its GPO. In such cases, use the
present field to indicate which GPO number is used to power a GPI.

Example of entries:

```bash
name,type,sub_type,parent_name.1,status,priority,model,port,normal_state,logical_asset,gpo_powersource
GPIO-Sensor-Door1,device,sensorgpio,IPC1,active,P1,DCS001,1,opened,Rack1,
GPIO-Sensor-Smoke1,device,sensorgpio,IPC1,active,P1,DCS001,1,opened,Room1,1
GPIO-Beacon1,device,sensorgpio,IPC1,active,P1,GPOGEN,2,,Room1,
```

In the above example, we have:

* One door contact sensor, 'GPIO-Sensor-Door1', connected to the first GPI of
the IPC, and located on the door of 'Rack1',
* One smoke detection sensor, 'GPIO-Sensor-Smoke1', connected to the second GPI
of the IPC, powered by the first GPO (gpo_powersource = 1), and located in
'Room1',
* One beacon, 'GPIO-Beacon1', connected to the second GPO of the IPC, and
located in 'Room1'.

## Architecture

### Overview

fty-sensor-gpio is composed of 3 actors:

* assets actor: requests all sensorgpio to the assets agent, and then listen to
ASSETS stream (for further addition / deletion / update, to find GPIO sensors
and configure the agent. These information are then used by the server.
* server actor: handles GPI polling and related metrics publication. This actor
also handles mailbox requests, to serve the manifest of supported GPIO devices,
create additional template files or act on GPO devices upon command reception
* alerts are managed by fty-alert-flexible

### Template files

Template files describe a GPIO sensor, and provide default values (such as
'normal-state') in case the user does not provide it through the commissioning.

Warning: Template files are mandatory! If there is no template file for a
commissioned sensor, this sensor will not be monitored!

Template files are provided in the 'src/selftest-ro/data/' directory of the
source tree, and installed by default to '/usr/share/fty-sensor-gpio/data/'.

Template files are named using the 'part-number' field, with the '.tpl'
(template) file extension, and have the following format:

```bash
manufacturer   = <value>
part-number    = <value>
type           = <value>
normal-state   = <value>
gpx-direction  = <value>
power-source   = <value>
alarm-severity = <value>
alarm-message  = <value>
```

For example:

```bash
manufacturer   = Eaton
part-number    = DCS001
type           = door-contact-sensor
normal-state   = closed
gpx-direction  = GPI
power-source   = external
alarm-severity = WARNING
alarm-message  = Door has been $status
```

'power-source' allows to specify if a sensor is:

* self-powered, through the GPI itself (value: 'internal'),
* external powered, through another GPO or a pure external source
(value: 'external'). In case where a GPO is powering a GPI, refer to the
Commissioning chapter above, and look at "gpo_powersource".

'alarm-message' can be adapted at runtime through the use of some variables, to
adapt the alert message:

* "$status": is replaced by the pattern "opened" or "closed"
* "$device_name": is replaced by the sensor name which has generated the alert
* "$location": is replaced by the sensor location


## Protocols

### Published metrics

Metrics are published on the '_METRICS_SENSOR' stream.

For example:

```bash
stream=_METRICS_SENSOR
sender=fty-sensor-gpio
subject=status.GPI2@sensorgpio-90
D: 13-01-28 10:22:53 FTY_PROTO_METRIC:
D: 13-01-28 10:22:53     aux=
D: 13-01-28 10:22:53         port=GPI2
D: 13-01-28 10:22:53     time=1359368573
D: 13-01-28 10:22:53     ttl=300
D: 13-01-28 10:22:53     type='status.GPI2'
D: 13-01-28 10:22:53     name='sensor-90'
D: 13-01-28 10:22:53     value='opened'
D: 13-01-28 10:22:53     unit=''
```

### Published alerts

Alerts are published on the '_ALERTS_SYS' stream.

Alarm messages:

* When new sensor is configured, fty-alert-engine configures rule which is used by fty-alert-flexible to evaluate sensor state.
* Rules contain lua functions which are executed everytime metric from the sensor is received.
* When value in metric (current sensor state) is not equal to desired state alert is generated by fty-alert-flexible.
* Each type of gpio sensor has its own rule.

Example of alert message:

```bash
stream=_ALERTS_SYS
sender=fty-alert-flexible
subject=door-contact.state-change@sensorgpio-19/WARNING@sensorgpio-19
D: 17-09-04 08:23:49 FTY_PROTO_ALERT:
D: 17-09-04 08:23:49     aux=
D: 17-09-04 08:23:49     time=1504513429
D: 17-09-04 08:23:49     ttl=750
D: 17-09-04 08:23:49     rule='door-contact.state-change@sensorgpio-19'
D: 17-09-04 08:23:49     name='sensorgpio-19'
D: 17-09-04 08:23:49     state='ACTIVE'
D: 17-09-04 08:23:49     severity='WARNING'
D: 17-09-04 08:23:49     description='Door to Rack01 is opened. Reported '
D: 17-09-04 08:23:49     action='EMAIL'
```
